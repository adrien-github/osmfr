OSM-FR integration into KDE marble
=====================================

The french community did a very good job at providing an `OpenStreetMap rendering <http://tile.openstreetmap.fr/>`_ well adapted for french people.

The virtual globe `Marble <https://marble.kde.org/>`_ from KDE is also a good software to navigate through the world.

This project provides a Marble map that uses OSM-FR rendering. It also provides HillShading as an option.

Any improvement is welcome!
